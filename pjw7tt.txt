Phi Lu, pjw7tt
I have taken Intro to Embedded, Embedded Systems, and Computer Architecture. I was a TA last year for ECE 3430 and have experience working with STM32 microcontrollers using C.
In my free time, I enjoy exercising and going to concerts. To attempt to become a better programmer, I've began Leetcoding, attempting Easy-Medium difficulty problems. I also like to explore the diverse food options within and around Charlottesville. By the end of this class, I want to become more experienced in developing real-time embedded systems that interact with the physical world. I am fascinated by wearable technologies and hope to apply my knowledge to engineer these in the future.
