	In terms of my background for embedded systems design and programming, I have taken both Introduction to Embedded Systems and Computer Systems Organizations 2. 
	I have been a TA for both CSO courses. Currently, I am a TA for Introduction to Embedded Systems this semester. Outside of being a TA, I am currently work on developing a low cost water level sensor to be deployed in flooding prone areas. 

 Your background in embedded systems design and programming, including any
previous embedded systems, computer architecture, or operating systems courses
that you have taken, relevant projects you have done, and any micro-controllers,
embedded platforms, and programming languages you have used.
 A short paragraph on your interests and what you expect to take out of this class.
